# gcal_event_creator

An extension that provides a shortcut for creating google calendar events

Some references I used to create my project:
Google Chrome Extensions require a manifest.json file: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest

Google Calendar API Overview: https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/overview (look at how to use the API)

Configuring OAuth: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent

TODO: Update ReadMe
TODO: Make sure that once you click create events, and then you click off, it doesn't delete the event list and you can go back to the extension and click any updates you might want to have before clicking add events.
